# Resume Builder

Resume Builder is a simple web-based application that allows users to generate a professional resume by filling out a form with their personal information. Once generated, users can edit the resume directly on the same page, download it as a PDF, or share it via a unique shareable link.


## Features
**Static Resume:** A pre-built static resume template is available for users to view.
**Dynamic Resume Generation:** Users can generate their resume by clicking the "Generate Your Resume" button, filling out a form, and automatically generating a resume in the format of the static one.
**Inline Editing:** After generating the resume, users can edit their details directly on the page to further customize their resume.
**Download as PDF:** Once the resume is generated, users can download it as a PDF file.
**Copy Shareable Link:** The resume can also be shared via a unique URL link based on the user's name.


## How It Works
**Static Resume:**
Initially, users are presented with a static resume template that serves as an example.
If the user wishes to create a similar resume, they can click the "Generate Your Resume" button.


**Generating Resume:**
After clicking the "Generate Your Resume" button, a form appears where users can fill in their details, including:
Name
City & Country
Contact Number
Email Address
LinkedIn Profile
A brief summary
Work Experience
Skills
Education
Upon submitting the form, the inputted details are used to generate a new resume in the format of the static one.


**Editing the Generated Resume:**
Once the resume is generated, users can edit any part of it directly on the page. This allows for real-time customization of the resume.


**Downloading the Resume:**
A Download PDF button is available for users to download the generated resume in PDF format.


**Copying Shareable Link:**
The Copy Shareable Link button allows users to copy a unique URL based on their name (e.g., username.vercel.app/resume). This link can be shared with others to view the resume online.
