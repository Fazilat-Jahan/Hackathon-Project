# Resume Builder

This Hackathon project is a Resume Builder application that allows users to generate a resume dynamically based on the information they input. The project consists of two main components:

**Static Resume Page:** A static resume that includes a button to generate a dynamic resume.
**Dynamic Resume Generation:** A form where users can input their personal information to generate a custom resume. The generated resume can be viewed in a new tab and downloaded as a PDF.
